# C# Unit
All of these scripts are from thenewboston's C# Beginners tutorial. As it may have inconsistencies and errors in the series, I try to correct them in here. Some examples include:

<ul>
<li>Uploading the same video multiple times (e.g. Tutorial 45, 46, and 48)</li>
<li>Creating new objects every time a button is pressed and then deleting them afterwards (it is faster to create the object when the class is created and then reuse it)</li>
<li>Putting data in an interface (it is generally not a good idea to do this)</li>
<li>Uploading videos out of order (this shouldn't affect me too much though)</li>
<li>Using absolute paths (this is a big no, especially in tutorials)</li>
</ul>

As I find more issues in the 64 tutorials we are supposed to do, I will update this list accordingly.
